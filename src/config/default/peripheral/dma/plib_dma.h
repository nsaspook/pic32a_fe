/**
 * @brief   Schedules a DMA transfer on the specified DMA channel.
 * @details This function schedules a DMA transfer on the specified DMA channel and starts the transfer
 *          when the configured trigger is received. The transfer is processed based on the channel
 *          configuration performed in the DMA manager. The channel parameter specifies the channel to
 *          be used for the transfer.
 *
 *          The srcAddr parameter specifies the source address from where data will be transferred.
 *
 *          The destAddr parameter specifies the address location where the data will be stored.
 *
 *          If the channel is configured for a software trigger, calling the channel transfer function
 *          will set the source and destination address and will also start the transfer. If the channel
 *          was configured for a peripheral trigger, the channel transfer function will set the source and
 *          destination address and will transfer data when a trigger has occurred.
 *
 *          If the requesting client registered an event callback function before calling the channel transfer
 *          function, this function will be called when the transfer completes. The callback function will be
 *          called with a DMA_TRANSFER_EVENT_BLOCK_TRANSFER_COMPLETE event if the transfer was processed
 *          successfully and a DMA_TRANSFER_EVENT_ERROR event if the transfer was not processed successfully.
 *
 *          When a transfer is already in progress, this API will return false indicating that the transfer
 *          request is not accepted.
 *
 * @pre     DMA should have been initialized by calling the DMA_Initialize. The required channel transfer
 *          parameters such as beat size, source and destination address increment should have been configured
 *          in MHC.
 *
 * @param[in] channel   The DMA channel that should be used for the transfer.
 * @param[in] srcAddr   Source address of the DMA transfer.
 * @param[in] destAddr  Destination address of the DMA transfer.
 * @param[in] blockSize Size of the transfer block in bytes.
 *
 * @return  True - if the transfer request is accepted.
 *          False - if a previous transfer is in progress and the request is rejected.
 *
 * @note None.
 *
 * @example
 * @code
 * MY_APP_OBJ myAppObj;
 * uint8_t buf[10] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};

/**
 * @brief    This API is used to setup DMA pattern matching.
 * @details  When the content of the incoming data is required in making decisions in real time,
 *           the 32-bit DMA Controller can recognize a data pattern in its internal buffer being
 *           transferred from the source to the destination locations. The pattern match capability,
 *           when enabled, allows a user-programmable data pattern to be compared against a (partial)
 *           content of DMABUF[31:0]. Upon match detection, the DMA Controller invokes its interrupt
 *           to inform the CPU to take further action.
 *
 * @pre      DMA should have been initialized by calling DMA_Initialize.
 * @param    channel            DMA channel
